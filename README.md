## Description
By clicking the "generate" button, users are prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters and decide whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Once the choices are made, the script provides a custom password in a dedicated field. If any selections are invalid, an error message appears.# PassGenWebinar
